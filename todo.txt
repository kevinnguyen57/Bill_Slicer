Getting Started
Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
    What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.

If using the CS50 Codespace, create a directory called project to store your project source code and other files. You are welcome to develop your project outside of the CS50 Codespace.


Step 1 of 3
Create a short video (that’s no more than 3 minutes in length) in which you present your project to the world. Your video must begin with an opening section that displays:

your project’s title;
your name;
your GitHub and edX usernames;
your city and country;
and, the date you have recorded this video.
It should then go on to demonstrate your project in action, as with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. See
howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen for tips on how to make a “screencast,”though you’re welcome to use an actual camera.
Upload your video to YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, a similar site) and take note of its URL; it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private.”

Submit this form!


Step 2 of 3
Create a README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your project folder that explains your project. This file should include your Project Title,
the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.

# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
TODO

If unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub’s Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax helpful. You can also preview your .md file by clicking the ‘preview’ icon as explained here:
Markdown Preview in vscode. Standard software project READMEs can often run into the thousands or tens of thousands of words in length; yours need not be that long, but should at least be
several hundred words that describe things in detail!


Step 3 of 3
Be sure to visit your gradebook at cs50.me/cs50x a few minutes after you submit. It’s only by loading your Gradebook that the system can check to see whether you have completed the course,
and that is also what triggers the (instant) generation of your free CS50 Certificate and the (within 30 days) generation of the Verified Certificate from edX, if you’ve completed all of
the other assignments. Be sure to claim your free certificate (by following the link at the top of your gradebook) before 1 January 2026.


That’s it! Your project should be graded within a few minutes. If you don’t see any results in your gradebook, best to resubmit (running the above submit50 command) with only your README.md file this time. No need to resubmit your form.

This was CS50x!
